Day 3: little Raptor goes on an adventure?
who is this little raptor?
That is you silly, it is Yi Yuan. 
Who were you calling a little piggy this morning? huh?
It's a cute guy called Carson Zellman. Do you know him?
Wo bu zhi dao. Who is he?
he is my boyfriend. Is he you?
Of course! He loves you very much!


Do you miss skiing?
Yeah! Maybe we can go this weekend??
yeah but I am kind of worried that the mountain will be icy since there won't be any snow in these days. But hopefully this Thursday and Friday it will snow more. *_*
Me too...We need it to snow, otherwise the conditions will be very bad. If it snows on Friday, we can go this weekend. Otherwise we will have to try another time.
So where are we eating this Friday? We still need to finish The Matrix too!
I want to take you to the hunan restaurant if that can make you more look forward to this weekend.
I am already looking forward to this weekend, baby. I am very excited to spend some time with you! We will see - my only concern is we are broke :( 
we don't need to order that much.and we only eat once in this week. I will pay @_@
